# Machine Learning Engineer Interview Prep

Machine Learning Engineer interviews are about **making models work**.

Not inventing new algorithms.
Not building perfect pipelines.
And not writing research code that only runs once.

ML Engineers are hired to turn data into **reliable, measurable improvements** in production systems.

If you prepare like a researcher or a generic software engineer,
you will miss what interviewers are actually testing.

## What Machine Learning Engineers Are Responsible For

ML Engineers typically own:
- data and feature pipelines
- model training and evaluation
- experimentation and iteration
- deployment, monitoring, and maintenance
- performance and reliability of models in production

The core skill is **systematic progress under real-world constraints**.

## What Interviewers Are Testing

Interviewers evaluate whether you can:

- identify useful signal in messy data
- choose metrics aligned with business goals
- design experiments that lead to clear decisions
- debug model performance issues
- operate models after deployment

They are **not** primarily testing:
- theoretical proofs
- knowledge of obscure algorithms
- academic-style model optimization

They want to know if you can **improve a model that already exists**.

## How to Use This Section

1. Start with `data-and-features.md`  
   Focus on feature prioritization and data leakage.

2. Review `training-and-evaluation.md`  
   Learn how to choose metrics and evaluate progress correctly.

3. Study `experimentation.md`  
   Understand how to design experiments that actually move metrics.

4. Read `production-and-monitoring.md`  
   Interviews often probe what happens *after* deployment.

Practice explaining:
- why you chose a metric
- what you would try next
- how you would detect failures

---

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Optimizing offline metrics without business context
- Ignoring data quality issues
- Running too many experiments at once
- Treating retraining as a solution to all problems
- Failing to monitor models after launch

These mistakes signal inexperience quickly.

## Final Advice

Strong Machine Learning Engineers:
- start with simple baselines
- iterate methodically
- measure impact continuously

If you can explain **how you would improve a mediocre model step by step**,
you are preparing at the level interviewers expect.
