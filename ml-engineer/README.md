# Machine Learning Engineer Interview Prep

## What interviewers are testing

ML Engineers are evaluated on their ability to:
- turn data into signal
- improve models iteratively
- reason about metrics and trade-offs
- operate models in production

This is not a research role.
This is not a pure software role.

It is about **making models work reliably**.
