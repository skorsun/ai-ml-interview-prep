# Experimentation

## Question
How do you decide which experiments to run next?

### What interviewers are testing
- prioritization
- speed vs rigor trade-offs

### Great answer
I prioritize experiments based on expected impact and effort.
I run fast, cheap experiments first to eliminate weak ideas.

If multiple changes are needed, I isolate variables
so I understand which change caused the improvement.
