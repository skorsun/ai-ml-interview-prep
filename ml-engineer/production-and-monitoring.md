# Production & Monitoring

## Question
How do you detect model degradation?

### What interviewers are testing
- operational awareness
- monitoring maturity

### Great answer
I monitor:
- input feature distributions
- prediction confidence
- downstream business metrics

If performance drops, I investigate root causes
before retraining to avoid masking systemic issues.
