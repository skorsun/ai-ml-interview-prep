# AI Architect Interview Prep

AI Architect interviews are not about models.

They are about **long-term technical decisions** that shape
how AI systems are built, scaled, governed, and evolved across an organization.

If you prepare like an engineer, you will underperform.
If you prepare like a researcher, you will miss the point entirely.

This role is about **architecture, ownership, and strategy**.

## What AI Architects Are Responsible For

AI Architects typically own:
- end-to-end AI platform design
- system boundaries and integration patterns
- scalability, reliability, and cost controls
- governance, security, and compliance
- long-term technical direction

Their decisions affect **multiple teams and products**.

---

## What Interviewers Are Testing

Interviewers evaluate whether you can:

- design AI systems that scale across teams
- balance centralization vs autonomy
- manage technical risk and blast radius
- reason about cost, latency, and reliability trade-offs
- make decisions that remain valid over years, not months

They are **not** testing:
- your ability to code models
- knowledge of the latest frameworks
- prompt engineering tricks

They are testing **architectural judgment**.

## How to Use This Section

1. Start with `platform-design.md`  
   Understand how to structure AI systems at an organizational level.

2. Review `scalability-and-governance.md`  
   Focus on ownership, versioning, and access control.

3. Study `cost-and-performance.md`  
   AI systems fail silently when cost is ignored.

4. Read `long-term-strategy.md`  
   Architecture is about designing for change, not perfection.

Practice explaining:
- why a boundary exists
- who owns what
- how failures are contained

---

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Over-designing early
- Centralizing everything without team autonomy
- Ignoring operational cost growth
- Treating models as permanent assets
- Lacking a clear ownership model

These signal weak architectural maturity.

## Final Advice

Strong AI Architects:
- design for replacement, not permanence
- assume models and vendors will change
- optimize for organizational clarity

If you can explain **why your architecture will survive change**,
you are thinking at the level interviewers expect.
