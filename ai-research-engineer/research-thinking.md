# Research Thinking

## Question
How do you evaluate whether a new method truly improves performance?

### What interviewers are testing
- scientific rigor
- skepticism
- signal vs noise separation

### Great answer
I compare against strong baselines under identical conditions,
run multiple seeds, and analyze variance.
I focus on failure cases, not just average metrics.

One successful run is not evidence.
