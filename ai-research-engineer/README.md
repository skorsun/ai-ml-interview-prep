# AI Research Engineer Interview Prep

AI Research Engineer interviews are about **judgment**, not just knowledge.

This role sits between research and engineering.
You are expected to turn research ideas into **validated improvements** —
not just understand papers, and not just ship code.

If you prepare like an ML Engineer or an AI Engineer,
you will likely miss what interviewers are actually testing.

## What AI Research Engineers Are Responsible For

AI Research Engineers typically work on:
- implementing and extending research ideas
- designing controlled experiments
- validating whether improvements are real or noise
- translating papers into reliable code
- identifying why a method works or fails

The core skill is **scientific decision-making under uncertainty**.

## What Interviewers Are Testing

Interviewers evaluate whether you can:

- read and critique research papers
- design fair and repeatable experiments
- distinguish signal from randomness
- reason about generalization and failure modes
- make informed bets on research directions

They are **not** looking for:
- memorized equations
- paper summaries without insight
- impressive-sounding jargon

They are looking for **research taste**.

## How to Use This Section

1. Start with `research-thinking.md`  
   Understand how interviewers expect you to reason about progress.

2. Review `papers-and-implementation.md`  
   Learn how to translate papers into correct, testable code.

3. Study `experimentation.md`  
   Focus on baselines, controls, and evaluation rigor.

4. Analyze `failure-analysis.md`  
   Strong candidates learn more from failures than successes.

Practice explaining:
- what you would test
- why it matters
- what result would change your mind

---

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Treating one successful run as evidence
- Ignoring variance and instability
- Failing to reproduce baselines
- Over-focusing on novelty instead of impact
- Avoiding negative results

These mistakes signal weak research maturity.

---

## Final Advice

Strong AI Research Engineers:
- are skeptical of results, including their own
- care deeply about evaluation design
- optimize for learning, not just metrics

If you can explain **why** an idea is worth pursuing —
and how you would know if it fails —
you are demonstrating the level interviewers are looking for.
