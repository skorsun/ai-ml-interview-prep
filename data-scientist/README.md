# Data Scientist Interview Prep

Data Scientist interviews are about **decision-making**, not dashboards.

Strong Data Scientists are not hired to build models for their own sake.
They are hired to help organizations **make better decisions using data**.

If you prepare like an ML Engineer or focus only on statistics,
you will miss what interviewers are actually testing.

## What Data Scientists Are Responsible For

Data Scientists typically work on:
- framing vague business problems
- designing analyses that answer real questions
- validating assumptions in messy data
- communicating uncertainty and trade-offs
- influencing decisions and strategy

The core skill is **turning data into insight that changes behavior**.

## What Interviewers Are Testing

Interviewers evaluate whether you can:

- translate business questions into analytical tasks
- choose appropriate methods without over-engineering
- reason about bias, uncertainty, and limitations
- communicate results clearly to non-technical stakeholders
- measure whether your work actually had impact

They are **not** primarily testing:
- memorization of statistical formulas
- complex models without context
- perfect visualizations

They want to know if your work **leads to better decisions**.

## How to Use This Section

1. Start with `problem-framing.md`  
   Learn how to clarify decisions and success criteria.

2. Review `analysis-and-modeling.md`  
   Focus on choosing the right level of complexity.

3. Study `communication.md`  
   Interviews often test how you explain uncertainty.

4. Read `impact-and-prioritization.md`  
   Understand how to decide what analysis is worth doing.

Practice explaining:
- what decision your analysis supports
- what assumptions you are making
- how confident you are in the results

## Common Mistakes Candidates Make

- Jumping into modeling without framing the problem
- Overcomplicating analyses
- Ignoring data limitations
- Presenting results without uncertainty
- Measuring success by “insights generated” instead of decisions changed

These mistakes signal weak business alignment.

## Final Advice

Strong Data Scientists:
- start with the decision, not the data
- prefer simple methods that stakeholders trust
- measure success by impact, not sophistication

If you can explain **how your analysis would change a real decision**,
you are preparing at the level interviewers expect.
