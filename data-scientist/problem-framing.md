# Problem Framing

## Question
How do you translate a vague business question into an analysis?

### What interviewers are testing
- decision clarity
- business impact awareness

### Great answer
I first clarify what decision will be made using the analysis.
Then I define success in terms of changed behavior,
not just statistical significance.
