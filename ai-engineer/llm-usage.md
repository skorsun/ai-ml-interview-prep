## Question
When do you fine-tune vs prompt?

### What interviewers are testing
- cost-awareness
- operational judgment

### Great answer
I default to prompting.
Fine-tuning only makes sense when:
- behavior must be consistent
- data is stable and labeled
- prompting complexity becomes unmanageable

Fine-tuning is an operational commitment, not just a modeling choice.
