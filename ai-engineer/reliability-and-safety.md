# Reliability & Safety

## Question
How do you reduce hallucinations?

### What interviewers are testing
- realism
- safety thinking

### Great answer
I reduce hallucinations by:
- grounding responses in retrieved data
- limiting open-ended generation
- validating outputs against known constraints

I don’t rely on “better prompts” alone.
